                This page contains links to all the other pages in the the project. Styling and JavaScript still needs to be done. Basic idea is to have pages to look up/
                add students and professors. Students and Professors can then go to their associated class page and add/look up classes. 
                Buildings can also be found on a separate page. Classes can also be looked up without 'login'. Many features are yet to be implemented, WIP.
